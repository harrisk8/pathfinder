# Pathfinder Visualizer via Dijkstra's Algorithm

This project demonstrates the novelty of Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
The user selects a start node, end node, places walls, and the project will detect and illustrate the shortest path found between the two nodes.

<strong>Key:</strong><br/>
Green: Start Node<br/>
Red: End Node<br/>
Black: Wall<br/>
